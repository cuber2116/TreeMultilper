# Wallace Tree Multiplier

## Overview

The Wallace Tree Multiplier is a digital circuit design that efficiently multiplies two binary numbers using the Wallace tree algorithm. The Wallace tree structure minimizes the number of sequential additions required, enhancing speed compared to traditional multiplication methods.

## Introduction

The Wallace tree multiplier works by generating partial products for the inputs and then reducing them in stages using a tree-like structure of adders. This design allows for faster multiplication through parallelism and efficient use of resources.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Wallace Tree Multiplier consists of the following key components:

1. **Partial Product Generation**: 
   - Generates partial products using AND gates based on the input bit widths (5 bits).
  
2. **Wallace Tree Reduction**: 
   - Reduces the array of partial products to two rows using half adders and full adders.

3. **Final Adder**: 
   - Adds the two rows of sums generated by the Wallace tree to produce the final product.

4. **Top-Level Integration**: 
   - Integrates all the modules into a complete multiplier design 5x5 implementations.
